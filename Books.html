 chronicling the history of medicine.
Includes timelines, boxed features on significant
 medical breakthroughs, fascinating case histories,
anecdotes and medical curiosities. Contains 150 color photographs.</h2>

<h2>Twelve Diseases That Changed Our World offers engaging observations on a dozen diseases to serve 2 goals.
The opening chapters meet the title’s promise by tracing the impact of hereditary blood disorders porphyria
and hemophilia on the succession of European monarchs in the 16th through 18th centuries. Also presented 
is a riveting account of the consequences of a potato blight in 1840s Ireland, which forced migration of
millions to England and North America. Thereafter, the book turns to the topic of infectious diseases and 
the lessons learned from earlier responses to “unanticipated outbreaks of disease” to inform preparedness 
for future outbreaks. Specifically, the chapters are devoted to the study of cholera, smallpox, bubonic plaque,
 syphilis, tuberculosis, malaria, fever, influenza, and AIDS. These topics are familiar territory for Dr. Sherman, 
 who recently authored The Power of Plagues, in which he also examines 7 of these infections; his command of the 
 subject matter is evident.</h2>

<h2>Nearly nine times as many died from diseases during the American Revolution as did from 
wounds. Poor diet, inadequate sanitation and sometimes a lack of basic medical care caused 
such diseases as dysentery, scurvy, typhus, smallpox and others to decimate the ranks. Scurvy 
was a major problem for both the British and American navies, while venereal diseases proved to be a 
particularly vexing problem in New York. Respiratory diseases, scabies and other illnesses left nearly
4,000 colonial troops unable to fight when George Washington's troops broke camp at Valley Forge in June 1778.
From a physician's perspective, this is a unique history of the American Revolution and how diseases 
impacted the execution of the war effort. The medical histories of Washington 
and King George III are also provided.

<h2>The medical achievements of the post-war years rank as one of the supreme epochs
of human endeavour. Advances in surgical technique, new ideas about the nature of disease and huge 
innovations in drug manufacture vanquished most common causes of early death, But, since the mid-1970s 
the rate of development has slowed, and the future of medicine is uncertain. How has this happened
James Le Fanu's hugely acclaimed survey of the 'twelve definitive moments' of modern medicine and the 
intellectual vacuum which followed them has been fully revised and updated for this edition. The Rise
 and Fall of Modern Medicine is both riveting drama and a clarion call for change.</h2>

<h2>All disease requires an acidic body to exist in. Your body becomes acidic by habitual consumption 
of poisons in your food, drinks and water; such as white flour, white sugar, high fructose corn syrup,
 red meats and the chlorine and fluoride in your water.
This book teaches you how to reverse the acidity of your body, correct your diet deficiencies and to 
value Water, the very Essence of Life.
There are also some quick cures for some major diseases like migraines, kidney stones, 
heartburn and others. These cures may seem like miracle cures, but they are just science that
 has been around since man began living on this Earth
The thing that the Author adds to those centuries of proven healing science is how to recognize
 and avoid the saturation of poisons that have inundated our food, drinks and water supplies, 
 as well as personal hygiene items
The Author teaches you how to clean up your current diet and also gives you details on 
other things you can do to improve your health and speed you on to freedom from disease.
This book was written by a man who cured himself of 10 diseases doctors REFUSE to cure. And did 
so after doctors said he would be on dialysis or dead by 2009.</h2>

<h2>"In public health and in medicine, the concept of health-related quality of life 
refers to a person or group's perceived physical and mental health over time. Physicians
have often used health-related quality of life (HRQOL) to measure the effects of chronic illness
in their patients to better understand how an illness interferes with a person's day-to-day life. 
Similarly, public health professionals use health-related quality of life to measure the effects of 
numerous disorders, short- and long-term disabilities, and diseases in different populations. Tracking 
health-related quality of life in different populations can identify subgroups with poor physical or mental
health and can help guide policies or interventions to improve their health. Most conceptualizations of HRQL 
emphasize the effects of disease on physical, social/role, psychological/emotional, and cognitive functioning. 
This important book gathers the latest research from around the world in this field."--Publisher's description.</h2>
